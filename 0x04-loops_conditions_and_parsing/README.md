			0x04 Loops, conditions and parsing 

Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers programming in bash using loops conditions and parsing techniques

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

How to create SSH keys
What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
How to use while, until and for loops
How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
How to use the cut command
What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them
